Code from Hackference2014

2 Arduino sketches, one for the Sparkfun SM130 NFC Reader with wireless transmitter, the second for the wireless relay board to sound the 'fail' alarm.

Uses Node-RED to pull this all together, flow not readily exportable to github.

Uses http://iheartquotes.com/api to produce the random quotes.

Black NFC Tag generates Simpsons Chalkboard quotes,
Exposed NFC Tag generates Star Wars quotes.
